# Image Embedding Association Test

Ryan Steed

The Image Embedding Association Test (iEAT) is a statistical test for bias in unsupervised image representations. Read the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15052).

## Installation

```bash
# gather the dependencies for running scripts in this repo
conda env update environment.yml
conda activate ieat
# install the weat package locally
pip install -e weat
# install the ieat package locally
pip install -e .
```

## Usage
To run a basic test on a set of images, use the `test` function in `ieat.api`. 
SimCLR is downloaded automatically - but you must download a pre-trained version of iGPT yourself. 
For an example, see the [documentation](#documentation) and [tutorials](#tutorials-and-replications). 

### Documentation
The `ieat` package does not have a CLI. Use it programmatically by accessing the API module (`ieat.api`). 
Documentation for the `ieat` API is published at [rbsteed.com/ieat](https://rbsteed.com/ieat).

To generate the documentation, use `pdoc3`:
```
pdoc3 --html --output-dir docs --force ieat
git subtree push --prefix docs/ieat origin gh-pages
```

### Tutorials and Replications

This repo uses Colab scripts.
